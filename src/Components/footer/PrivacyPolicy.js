                <p>Protecting your privacy is important to us. Accordingly, we're providing this Privacy Policy
                    to explain our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information that we
                    receive when you use our Services (as defined in our Terms of Service). This Privacy Policy
                    applies only to those websites, services and applications included within "Services" and doesn't
                    apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through
                    our Services. Also, please note that, unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all
                    capitalized words used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service.</p>
                <br />
                <h4>How do we collect and use information?</h4>
                <p> Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your use of the
                    Services, and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services.
                    Account Information. When you make a Purchase we'll collect certain information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, email address,
                    phone number and payment information (including credit card or debit card details or bank account information)(<b>"Personally Identifiable
                        Information"</b> or <b>"PII"</b>). We don't receive or store passwords for any of your SNS Accounts.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>What Information Do We Share With Third Parties?</h4>
                <p>We will not share any PII that we have collected from you except as described below: </p>
                <p><u>Information Shared with Our Services Providers.</u>We may engage third party service providers to work with us to
                    administer and provide the Services, e.g., we use a third party payment processor when you purchase and/or sell
                    content on the Services. These third-party services providers have access to your PII only for the purpose of performing
                    services on our behalf and are expressly obligated not to disclose or use your PII for any other purpose.
                </p>
                <p><u>Information Shared with Third Parties.</u> We may share aggregated information and non-identifying information with third parties for
                    industry analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes.

                </p>
                <p><u>Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions.</u>Information that we collect from our users, including PII,
                    is considered to be a business asset. As a result, if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy or if we are acquired as a result of a
                    transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your PII may be disclosed or transferred to the third-party acquirer in connection
                    with the transaction.


                </p>
                <p><u>Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others.</u> It is our policy to protect you from having your
                    privacy violated through abuse of the legal systems, whether by individuals, entities or government, and to contest claims that
                    we believe to be invalid under applicable law. However, it is also our policy to cooperate with government and law enforcement
                    officials and private parties. Accordingly, we reserve the right to disclose any information about you to government or law
                    enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary: (i) to satisfy or comply with any
                    applicable law, regulation or legal process or to respond to lawful requests, including subpoenas, warrants or court orders;
                    (ii) to protect our property, rights and safety and the rights, property and safety of third parties or the public in general;
                    and (iii) to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical.

                </p>
                <p><u>Information We Disclose With Your Consent or at Your Request.</u> We will share your PII with third-party sites or
                    platforms, such as social networking sites, if you have expressly requested that we do so.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>The Security of Your Information</h4>
                <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your PII)
                    from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information
                    over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security
                    of any information.
